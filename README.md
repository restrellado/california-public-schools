# California Public Schools: Cleaned Data Set  

PURPOSE:
This repository is for cleaning the California Department of Education's database 
of public schools. It can then be used as a lookup table or for making 
interactive maps. The original dataset is available publicly from [CDE's 
website](http://www.cde.ca.gov/ds/si/ds/pubschls.asp). 

The RMD file documents the cleaning process and outputs the cleaned csv in the 
`data` folder.
